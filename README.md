# Ames-Housing-ML-Project
I am currently a data science fellow at the New York City Data Science Academy.

Buying and selling houses is something many people will do in their lives. For some, it may be the single biggest investment of their lives. For others, it may be something done repeatedly as part of a career in real estate or to generate extra income.  In all these scenarios, the people involved need to be informed in order to be empowered to negotiate better deals and maximize their returns. 
However, taking into account all the variables involved in a sale price for a home is not a simple matter. The real estate market is not only complex but constantly changing. Values rise and fall based on changes in location, economic conditions, and particular property features. 

Thatâ€™s why, machine learning has emerged as a powerful tool to analyze large amounts of housing data and uncover patterns that traditional methods might miss. By leveraging these techniques, we can build predictive models that estimate home prices, forecast market trends, and identify key factors driving property values. These predictions help buyers, sellers, and investors navigate the market with greater confidence and make smarter, data-driven decisions.

For this project, I focused on the Ames Housing Dataset, which encompasses 79 features, a target variable (Sale Price), and 2580 observations. What is the best linear model that can be created using the least amount of features to help best explain the sale price of a house? How much can we expect a house with certain features to sell for?
