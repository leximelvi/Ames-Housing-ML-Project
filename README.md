# Ames-Housing-ML-Project
I am currently a data science fellow at the New York City Data Science Academy.

Buying and selling houses is a part of many people’s lives, whether it’s to generate extra income, secure a place to live, or as part of a professional career. The real estate market is complex and constantly changing, influenced by factors such as location, economic conditions, and property features. Understanding the housing market of a particular area is crucial for making informed decisions, negotiating better deals, and maximizing value.

In recent years, machine learning has emerged as a powerful tool to analyze large amounts of housing data and uncover patterns that traditional methods might miss. By leveraging these techniques, we can build predictive models that estimate home prices, forecast market trends, and identify key factors driving property values. These predictions help buyers, sellers, and investors navigate the market with greater confidence and make smarter, data-driven decisions.

For this project, I focused on the Ames Housing Dataset, which encompasses 79 features, a target variable (Sale Price), and 2930 observations. What is the best linear model that can be created using the least amount of features to help best explain the sale price of a house? How much can we expect a house with certain features to sell for?
